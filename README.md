# Introduction to artificial neural networks in Python

This half-day lesson gives an introduction to artificial neural networks. During the lesson we prepare and visualise data for algorithm development, and construct a neural network that is able to classify disease in X-rays.

It is the third lesson in the machine learning curriculum. In the final lesson we explore the important area of responsible machine learning.
