## Convolutional neural networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are popular for image processing tasks. 

The general concepts that we learnt previously still apply. We modify our architecture to include layers that are designed to recognise structure within images.

## Adding convolutional layers

A typical Convolutional Neural Network comprises of a combination of the following layers:

- Convolutional layer: 
- Pooling layer: 
- Dense layer: 

## Creating the convolutional neural network

As before we will use building blocks from the TensorFlow library.

## Defining the loss function and optimizer

[TODO: introduce loss function and optimizer]

## Review the model architecture

[TODO: introduce the plot]

## Train the model

We now call the `fit()` method on the training data to train our network. 

[TODO: plot metrics]

## Evaluation

[TODO: model evaluation and compare to previous model.]
