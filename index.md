## Introduction

This lesson introduces the core concepts of **artificial neural networks** through a practical application in healthcare: training a model to classify chest X-ray images. 

You’ll learn how to:
- Load and visualize medical imaging data
- Prepare images for use in machine learning
- Build and train a convolutional neural network
- Evaluate model performance
- Explore explainability techniques using saliency maps

By the end of the lesson, you'll have constructed a neural network capable of detecting pleural effusion in chest X-rays — a real-world example of how machine learning can assist clinical decision-making.
