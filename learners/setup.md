## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Install Python

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.
Although one can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand, we recommend installing [Anaconda][anaconda-website],
a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson.
Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found
on The Carpentries [template website for workshops][anaconda-instructions]
and in [Anaconda documentation][anaconda-install].

## Obtain lesson materials

The data that we are going to use for this project consists of 700 chest X-rays. These X-rays are a subset of the public NIH ChestX-ray dataset.

> Xiaosong Wang, Yifan Peng, Le Lu, Zhiyong Lu, Mohammadhadi Bagheri, Ronald Summers, ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases, IEEE CVPR, pp. 3462-3471, 2017

1. Download [chest\_xrays.zip](./data/chest_xrays.zip).
2. Create a folder called `carpentries-ml-neural` on your Desktop.
3. Move downloaded files to `carpentries-ml-neural`.

## Launch Python interface

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like.

## Option A: Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based interface for working with Python.
If you installed Anaconda, you can launch a notebook in two ways:

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Anaconda Navigator

1. Launch Anaconda Navigator.
  It might ask you if you'd like to send anonymized usage information to Anaconda developers:
  ![Anaconda Navigator first launch](
  {{ page.root }}{% link fig/anaconda-navigator-first-launch.png %})
  Make your choice and click "Ok, and don't show again" button.
2. Find the "Notebook" tab and click on the "Launch" button:
  ![Anaconda Navigator Notebook launch](
  {{ page.root }}{% link fig/anaconda-navigator-notebook-launch.png %})
  Anaconda will open a new browser window or tab with a Notebook Dashboard showing you the
  contents of your Home (or User) folder.
3. Navigate to the `data` directory by clicking on the directory names leading to it:
  `Desktop`, `swc-python`, then `data`:
  ![Anaconda Navigator Notebook directory](
  {{ page.root }}{% link fig/jupyter-notebook-data-directory.png %})
4. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button and then selecting "Python 3":
  ![Anaconda Navigator Notebook directory](
  {{ page.root }}{% link fig/jupyter-notebook-launch-notebook.png %})
  

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Command line (Terminal)

1\. Navigate to the `data` directory:

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Unix shell

If you're using a Unix shell application, such as Terminal app in macOS, Console or Terminal
in Linux, or [Git Bash][gitbash] on Windows, execute the following command:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/swc-python/data
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Command Prompt (Windows)

On Windows, you can use its native Command Prompt program.  The easiest way to start it up is
pressing <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd>\+<kbd>R</kbd>, entering `cmd`, and hitting
<kbd>Return</kbd>. In the Command Prompt, use the following command to navigate to
the `data` folder:

```source
cd /D %userprofile%\Desktop\swc-python\data
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

2\. Start Jupyter server

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Unix shell

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Command Prompt (Windows)

```source
python -m notebook
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

3\. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button on the right and selecting "Python 3"
from the drop-down menu:
![Anaconda Navigator Notebook directory](
{{ page.root }}{% link fig/jupyter-notebook-launch-notebook2.png %})

## Option B: Cloud Notebook

Colaboratory, or "Colab", is a cloud service that allows you to run a Jupyter-like Notebook in a web browser. To open a notebook, visit the [Colaboratory website][google-colab]. You can upload your datasets using the "Files" panel on the left side of the page.
